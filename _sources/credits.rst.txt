The book `The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating
Growth and Change`__ by Camille Fournier served as inspiration for this
guide.  In fact, you could go so far as to say that most of the basic
ideas of this guide come from here, with added commentary and
interpretation for the academic setting.
